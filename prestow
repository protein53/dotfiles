# Usage:
# Assumption here is that your stow directory is in ~/dotfiles and
# 'prestow' (this bash script) is inside this stow directory.
# 1. cd ~/dotfiles
# 2. ./prestow --> this will create 'origdot' in your home folder
#     organized like this
#     ~/origdot/
#     └── server_defaults/
#         ├── .bashrc
#         └── .config/
#             └── nvim/
#                 └── init.lua
# 3. stow *  --> this will symlink your favorite dot files,
# 4.  Use the system. All your dot files are now in effect.
#     When you are done and want to restore the original
#     dot files, go to step 5.
# 5.  cd ~/dotfiles
#     stow -D *
#     cd ~/origdot/server_defaults
#     stow *
# 6.  All original dot files are now restored.
